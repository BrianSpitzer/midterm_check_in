# Midterm Check In

 - Please fork this repo to check in for the midterm. This is to help us know who is here, since some students requested to attend a section for which they are not enrolled.
 - Just click the "Fork" button in the top-right; you don't have to do anything else.
    - **If you haven't clicked the button by 6:02pm**, you'll likely have to come up front and give me your GitHub username individually.
 - In a moment, navigate back to https://github.com/appdevsummer17 and refresh, or check your inbox.
 - You'll see a banner across the top of that page with an invitation from us to join a team. Accept it.
 - A new repository will appear in the list: `catalog`. This is the midterm.
 - Read all of the instructions in the README carefully before you begin.
 - The exam ends at 7:35pm and class begins again at 7:50pm.
 - There ought to be food and drinks set up outside the classroom by 7:30pm. Fix yourself a plate before you come back in.
 - Good luck!
